		<p>My son is constantly receiving new toys.  I have the inability to decipher when his attention has truely wained from a toy.  Plus, whenever we are out at Barnes and Noble, who has an amazing selection of toys and do not seem to care if the babies play with them, I end up buying him yet another toy.</p>

		<p>Each toy is played with in turn and then neglected for blocks and boxes.  Always blocks and boxes.</p>

		<p>Therefore, to help myself and perhaps others, I am creating a tally on all of the toys that I purchase for him.  How long was with this one did he initially play?  Did that one break easily?  Could I clean it without cursing or throwing it in the trash?</p>

		<p>Let's find out!</p>
