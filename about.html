		<h3>Mary (a.k.a. "Mommmm")</h3>
		<p>Originally from Georgia, Mary moved to NYC with her husband Tim in 2010.
		</p>
		<p>In 2013, she brought little Joey into the world.  Her small family lives in a small apartment where the play area is small and getting outside is a daily necessity.</p>

		<p>Now this family of three is exploring life in the big city and taking it one day at a time.</p>

		<h3>Joey (a.k.a. "Bugga")</h3>
		<p>Small, energetic, and unstoppable.  Those are the only three words you really need to know about the master of disaster, Joey.</p>
